# n-gon-ring
n-gon-ring puzzle game

## WIP

Made with Java using libgdx framework for graphics.

If you have libgdx installed, you can (probably) just import the complete repository with intelliJ Idea and run DesktopLauncher.java in /n-gon-ring/desktop. A ready-to-run version will be uploaded soon.

Main logic is found in /core/src/com/jashlaviu/ngon
